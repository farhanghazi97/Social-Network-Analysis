/* Finds shortest paths from a given source vertex to all other vertices, as discussed in the lectures.

 * The function offers one ** additional feature **, the function keeps track of multiple 
 * predecessors for a node on (multiple) shortest paths from the source, if they exist.  
 *
 * We will discuss this point in detail in the lecture. The basic idea is,  
 * the array of lists "pred" keeps track of multiple predecessors (if they exist) for 
 * a node on (multiple) shortest paths. Each linked list offers possible predecessors for a node.  
 *  
 * In the following example, while discovering shortest paths from source node '0', we 
 * discovered that node '1' has two possible predecessors on possible shortest paths. 
 * 
Node 0
  Distance
    0 : X
    1 : 2
    2 : 1
  Preds
    0 : NULL
    1 : [0]->[2]->NULL
    2 : [0]->NULL

Node 1
  Distance
    0 : 2
    1 : X
    2 : 3
  Preds
    0 : [1]->NULL
    1 : NULL
    2 : [0]->NULL

Node 2
  Distance
    0 : 3
    1 : 1
    2 : X
  Preds
    0 : [1]->NULL
    1 : [2]->NULL
    2 : NULL

 * 
 * 
 * The function returns 'ShortestPaths' structure with the required information
 * (i.e. 'distance' array, 'predecessor' arrays, source and no_of_nodes in the graph)
